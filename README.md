## Demos

- Hands-on demo scripts are available in the [`demo/`](demo/) folder.
- Each demo includes step-by-step instructions and references to relevant lessons.
- Try these to practice real API calls and model comparisons.

## How to Grab Your Certificate

1. Complete **all three core tasks** in the [`task/`](task/) folder using Node.js.
2. Upload your solutions to your GitHub repository.
3. Submit your repository link using this form: [Submit Your Course Solutions](https://example.com/submit-form)
4. Once reviewed, you will receive your course certificate!

> **Note:** Only these three core tasks are required for certification. For extra learning and skill improvement, you are encouraged to also complete the advanced [Vision, Audio, and Open-Source Tasks](vision-audio-open-source-tasks.md), but these are optional and not required for the certificate.

## Staying Up-to-Date

The GitHub Models Marketplace is constantly evolving, with new models and providers added regularly. Always check the [GitHub Models Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/models) for the latest models, features, and SDKs. Review model cards for up-to-date documentation, rate limits, and capabilities.

> **Tip:** Some models offer advanced features like function calling, vision, or streaming. Use the Marketplace filters to find models that best fit your needs.
