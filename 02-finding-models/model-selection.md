# Selecting the Right Model

## Selection Criteria
1. **Task Type**:
   - Chat/conversation
   - Text completion
   - Code generation
   - Embeddings

2. **Model Characteristics**:
   - Context window size
   - Training data recency
   - Special capabilities (function calling, etc.)

3. **Performance Needs**:
   - Response time
   - Output quality
   - Cost considerations

4. **Rate Limits**:
   - Requests per minute/day
   - Token limits
   - Concurrent requests

## Recommendation Process
1. Define your use case
2. Identify must-have features
3. Compare models in playground
4. Test with your specific prompts
5. Evaluate performance

## Common Models
- GPT-4 variants
- Claude models
- Open-source alternatives
- Specialized models (code, etc.)

## Model Card Checklist
- Review the model card in the Marketplace for:
  - Supported capabilities (chat, code, vision, embeddings)
  - Rate limits and pricing
  - Example code and SDK support
  - Provider-specific features (function calling, streaming, etc.)
