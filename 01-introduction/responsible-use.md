# Responsible Use of GitHub Models

## Guidelines
1. **Understand Limitations**:
   - Models may generate incorrect or biased information
   - Outputs should be verified before use

2. **Content Filters**:
   - GitHub employs content filters that cannot be disabled
   - These filters help prevent harmful outputs
   - Each model may have unique limitations or content filters. Always review the model card and documentation in the Marketplace for provider-specific guidance.

3. **Proper Attribution**:
   - Clearly indicate when content is AI-generated
   - Don't present model outputs as human-generated

4. **Privacy Considerations**:
   - Don't input sensitive personal data
   - Be aware that prompts may be used to improve services

5. **Rate Limits**:
   - Respect the usage limits for free tier
   - Move to paid Azure services for production needs

## Best Practices
- Review outputs for accuracy
- Use appropriate disclaimers
- Monitor for unintended biases
- Stay updated on GitHub's AI policies
