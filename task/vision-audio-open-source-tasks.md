# Node.js Tasks: Vision, Audio, and Open-Source Models

This folder contains hands-on tasks for you to complete using Node.js and different model modalities from the GitHub Models Marketplace.

## Task 04: Image Captioning (Vision Model)
- **Goal:** Use a vision model to generate a caption for an image.
- **Steps:**
  1. Write a Node.js script that sends an image to a vision model (e.g., GPT-4V).
  2. Input: Any image file (e.g., 'sample-image.jpg').

## Task 06: Open-Source Model (Llama/Mistral)
- **Goal:** Use an open-source model to generate text based on a prompt.
- **Steps:**
  1. Write a Node.js script that calls an open-source model (e.g., Mistral) for text generation.
  2. Input: Any prompt string.
  3. Output: The generated text.
  4. Reference: [SDK Options](../04-api-integration/sdk-options.md)
